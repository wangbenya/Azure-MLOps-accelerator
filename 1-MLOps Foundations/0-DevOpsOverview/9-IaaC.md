# Infrastructure as Code

**Source**: [What is Infrastructure as Code](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/devops/deliver/what-is-infrastructure-as-code)

![Infrastructure as code defines the environment in a versioned file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/azureml-ops-accelerator/main/1-DesignforMLOps/0-DevOpsOverview/_img/InfrastructureAsCode_600x300-3.png)

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is the management of infrastructure (networks, virtual machines, load 
balancers, and connection topology) in a descriptive model, using the same versioning as DevOps team uses 
for source code. Like the principle that the same source code generates the same binary, an IaC model 
generates the same environment every time it is applied. IaC is a key DevOps practice and is used in 
conjunction with [continuous delivery](7-CD.md).

## IaC solves real problems

Infrastructure as Code evolved to solve the problem of _environment drift_ in the release pipeline.
Without IaC, teams must maintain the settings of individual deployment environments. Over time, each
environment becomes a _snowflake_, that is, a unique configuration that cannot be reproduced automatically.
Inconsistency among environments leads to issues during deployments. With snowflakes, administration and
maintenance of infrastructure involves manual processes which were hard to track and contributed to errors.

_Idempotence_ is a principle of Infrastructure as Code. Idempotence is the property that a deployment
command always sets the target environment into the same configuration, regardless of the environment's
starting state. Idempotency is achieved by either automatically configuring an existing target or by
discarding the existing target and recreating a fresh environment.

Accordingly, with IaC, teams make changes to the environment description and version the configuration
model, which is typically in well-documented code formats such as JSON. The release pipeline executes
the model to configure target environments. If the team needs to make changes, they edit the source,
not the target.

## IaC delivers real benefits

Infrastructure as Code enables DevOps teams to test applications in production-like environments early
in the development cycle. These teams expect to provision multiple test environments reliably and on demand.
Infrastructure represented as code can also be validated and tested to prevent common deployment issues.
At the same time, the cloud dynamically provisions and tears down environments based on IaC definitions.

Teams who implement IaC can deliver stable environments rapidly and at scale. Teams avoid manual
configuration of environments and enforce consistency by representing the desired state of their
environments via code. Infrastructure deployments with IaC are repeatable and prevent runtime issues
caused by configuration drift or missing dependencies. DevOps teams can work together with a unified set
of practices and tools to deliver applications and their supporting infrastructure rapidly, reliably, and
at scale.

## Prefer declarative definitions

The preferred approach to IaC is to use declarative definition files where possible. A definition file
specifies the _what_ an environment requires and not necessarily the _how_. In other words, it may define
the specific version and configuration of a server component as a requirement, but does not specify the
process for installing and configuring it. This abstraction allows for greater flexibility in the middle,
such as optimized techniques the infrastructure provider may employ. It also helps reduce the technical
debt of maintaining imperative code, such as deployment scripts, that can accrue over time.

There is no single standard syntax for declarative IaC. Different platforms support different, and often
multiple, file formats, such as YAML, JSON, and XML. As a result, the decision to select a syntax for
describing IaC usually comes down to the requirements of the target platform.

## Using IaC on Azure

Azure provides native support for IaC via the
[Azure Resource Manager](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/overview). Teams can define declarative
templates that specify the infrastructure required to deploy their solutions.

Teams can also use the IaC supported by popular third party platforms, such as 
[Terraform](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/terraform/overview), [Ansible](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/ansible/overview),
[Chef](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/chef/overview), and [Pulumi](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops/infrastructure-as-code-azure-python-wpulumi/) to manage automated infrastructure.
